# CIS 9665
### Introduction
#### Economic prosperity is often seen as the primary factor for living a good and happy life. The topic being investigated is how countries’ GDP affects the quality of life and the happiness of the citizens. Before datasets were analyzed, a hypothesis was formed, which is that the country’s GDP will affect the happiness and quality of life of the citizens. As a country’s GDP per capita increases, the quality of life and citizens’ happiness also increases. To prove this hypothesis, three datasets from Kaggle were used; one dataset for each metric that is being investigated. As each dataset had different numbers of countries, they were cleaned and merged to create different visualizations using Python, Tableau, and Excel. Some visualizations created are scatterplots, quadrant charts, bar charts, and geographical maps.
